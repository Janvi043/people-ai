## A web application that provides accessibilty features for colour blindness and neurodivergence in  video interfaces.


## Science Behind It

### The primary visual cortex, located in the occipital lobe, processes visual information including color contrast:
###  Signal Processing:It receives signals from the eyes via the optic nerve, processing basic visual features like shapes and colors. Neurons specialize in detecting color and contrast ### variations.
### Neuronal Specialization: Neurons in the primary visual cortex have specific receptive fields for color and contrast, enabling precise visual detail encoding.
### Perceptual Impact: This processing is crucial for visual perception, object recognition, and depth perception, supporting effective visual communication and design accessibility.



## Solution

###  Customizable Color Contrast: Improves visual clarity by allowing users to adjust video color contrast to reduce visual strain.
### Sensory Stimuli Management: Controls audio levels and filters out overwhelming noises to enhance auditory comfort.
### Personalized Playback Settings: Offers adjustable playback speed, subtitles, and viewing modes tailored to individual preferences.



## Advantages

###  Sensory Comfort: Adjusting color contrast can alleviate sensory overload for neurodiverse individuals, enhancing comfort and reducing visual distractions.
### Improved Clarity: Optimal color contrast improves readability and comprehension of information, aiding focus and understanding, especially for those with conditions like dyslexia or ### ADHD.
### Personalized Playback Settings: Offers adjustable playback speed, subtitles, and viewing modes tailored to individual preferences.
