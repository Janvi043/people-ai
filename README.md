## A web application that provides accessibilty features for colour blindness and neurodivergence in  video interfaces.


## Science Behind It
### The primary visual cortex, located in the occipital lobe, processes visual information
including color contrast:
### Signal Processing: It receives signals from the eyes via the optic nerve, processing
basic visual features like shapes and colors. Neurons specialize in detecting color
and contrast variations.
### Neuronal Specialization: Neurons in the primary visual cortex have specific receptive
fields for color and contrast, enabling precise visual detail encoding.
### Perceptual Impact: This processing is crucial for visual perception, object
recognition, and depth perception, supporting effective visual communication and
design accessibility.
